  abstract     = {While each of his or her two eyes was independently
    adapted to a different illuminant in viewing a complex visual
    field, each of a number of observers matched a series of test
    colors seen by one eye with a juxtaposed variable stimulus seen by
    the other eye. The 2 degrees test and matching stimuli were
    located centrally in the complex adapting field, which subtended
    an angle of 31 degrees X 24 degrees. In making the matches, the
    observer viewed the test and matching stimuli for a series of
    brief intervals (approximately 1 sec) while viewing the complex
    adapting field with normal eye movements. Nine experiments were
    performed with different pairs of illuminants and different
    illuminances ranging from that of an average living room to that
    of a scene illuminated with hazy sunlight. In three other
    experiments each of the observer's two eyes was adapted to a
    different illuminance of D55. The amount of adaptation was more
    nearly complete at high levels of illuminance than at low levels,
    and the proportional amount of adaptation was less for the "blue"
    receptors. When adaptation coefficients were determined from the
    actual adaptation differences (e.g., from corresponding
    tristimulus values for matching neutrals) rather than from the
    adapting illuminants, a linear von Kries transformation based on
    experimentally determined visual primaries gave corresponding
    chromaticities that were in good agreement with the results
    obtained in each of the chromatic-adaptation experiments, except
    at the lowest illuminances. The results of the experiments in
    which each eye was adapted to different levels of the same
    illuminant indicated again that adaptation to the different levels
    was incomplete, the proportional amount of adaptation being less
    at low illuminances and for the "blue" receptors. This caused a
    change in chromatic adaptation with the level of illuminance even
    when the chromaticities of the adapting lights were equal. The
    results of these experiments also indicated that higher purities
    are needed in order to produce the same absolute color appearances
    at low levels of illuminance.},

  abstract     = {Camera spectral sensitivity functions relate scene
    radiance with captured RGB triplets. They are important for many
    computer vision tasks that use color information, such as
    multispectral imaging, color rendering, and color constancy. In
    this paper, we aim to explore the space of spectral sensitivity
    functions for digital color cameras. After collecting a database
    of 28 cameras covering a variety of types, we find this space
    convex and two-dimensional. Based on this statistical model, we
    propose two methods to recover camera spectral sensitivities using
    regular reflective color targets (e.g., color checker) from a
    single image with and without knowing the illumination. We show
    the proposed model is more accurate and robust for estimating
    camera spectral sensitivities than other basis functions. We also
    show two applications for the recovery of camera spectral
    sensitivities - simulation of color rendering for cameras and
    computational color constancy.},

@article{Luo1999,
  abstract     = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides
    to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of
    applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking
    tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking
    program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and
    systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide
    sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the
    poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit
    solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top
    10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA}
    for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default
    Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and
    scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein
    structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed
    Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides)
    while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for
    a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was
    available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked
    successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized
    polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of
    limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of
    applicability for this approach.},
