Colour science datasets for use with
`Colour <https://github.com/colour-science/colour>`__ or any Python package
manipulating colours. The datasets are hosted in `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org>`__
under the
`Colour Science - Datasets <https://zenodo.org/communities/colour-science-datasets>`__
community.

It is open source and freely available under the

Features
--------

**Colour - Datasets** was created to overcome issues encountered frequently
when trying to access or use colour science datasets:

- No straightforward ingestion path for dataset content.
- No simple loading mechanism for dataset content.
- Unavailability of the dataset, e.g. download url is down, dataset content is
  passed directly from hand to hand.
- No information regarding the definitive origination of the dataset.

**Colour - Datasets** offers all the above: it allows users to ingest and load
colour science datasets with a single function call. The datasets information
is hosted on `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/communities/colour-science-datasets>`__
where the record for a dataset typically contain:

- An *urls.txt* file describing the urls to source the dataset files from.
- A copy of those files in the eventuality where the source files are not
  available or the content has changed without notice.
- Information about the authors, content and licensing.

When no explicit licensing information is available, the dataset adopts the
**Other (Not Open)** licensing scheme, implying that assessing usage conditions
is at the sole discretion of the users.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

**Colour - Datasets** can also be used online with
`Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#fileId=1YwIfDTBVP3XUYJAyZVEDWj92DJCB0_3v&offline=true&sandboxMode=true>`__.

Most of the objects are available from the ``colour_datasets`` namespace:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import colour_datasets

The available datasets are listed with the ``colour_datasets.datasets()``
definition:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> print(colour_datasets.datasets())
